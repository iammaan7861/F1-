# 🏎️ Formula 1 Data Analysis – Driver Performance & Safety Insights

This project is a deep dive into historical Formula 1 data to analyze driver performance, racing patterns, and safety trends — particularly focusing on understanding how data can help prevent accidents and improve decision-making in the sport.

## 📌 Why I Built This Project

As a motorsports enthusiast and a data analytics learner, I built this project to:
- Explore the application of data in a high-speed, high-risk environment like F1
- Understand patterns in driver fatalities and incidents over the years
- Demonstrate how insights from data can help enhance safety measures

---

## ✅ What Problem It Solves

F1 generates enormous volumes of race data — lap times, speeds, weather, incidents, and more — but these are often underused. This project extracts actionable insights from raw race data to:
- Track and compare driver performance lap-by-lap
- Identify high-risk tracks and race conditions
- Analyze trends in fatal accidents over the years

---

## 🌍 Real-World Relevance

This project shows how data analytics can be used to:
- **Improve driver safety** by identifying conditions or tracks linked to accidents
- **Support teams and regulatory bodies** in making informed design and strategy decisions
- **Spot early warning signals** from past data that can prevent future tragedies

Example: If we notice a rise in driver deaths in specific eras or tracks, it opens discussion on track redesign or stricter regulations.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack & Tools

- **Python** (Data Cleaning & Processing - Pandas, NumPy)
- **SQL Server** (for structured querying and filtering)
- **Power BI** (Data visualization and interactive dashboards)
- **CSV** files (Source data: lap-by-lap stats, driver deaths, race history)

---

## 📊 Key Features

- Driver-wise lap performance comparison (sector-wise)
- Race-wise analysis of laps, average speed, and position changes
- Historical chart of F1 driver fatalities (year-wise & circuit-wise)
- Safety insights based on conditions and patterns in the data

---

## 🔄 Scalability

This project is designed to scale with:
- Additional race seasons and drivers
- Real-time telemetry data integration
- ML-based crash risk prediction models
- More visual dashboards and story-driven analysis

---

## 🧠 Learnings

- Data pipeline: from messy CSVs to clean SQL-structured tables
- Writing efficient SQL queries for performance comparison
- Crafting insightful dashboards in Power BI
- Data storytelling and presenting analytical findings visually
